\subsection{Description Design Pattern 2}
The definition of our levels are made in a .txt file. The problem here is determining what object of Model is loaded where. In the Factory Method pattern this is fixed by a Factory. In our case it's called LevelFactory. LevelController calls this class to load the .txt file, and eventually create all objects that are noted in the file. Then it returns a Level which LevelController uses.
