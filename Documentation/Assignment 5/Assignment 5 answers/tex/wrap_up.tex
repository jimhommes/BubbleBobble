\chapter{Wrap up â€“ Reflection}

`Your journey with Software Engineering Methods is coming to an end: The next iteration will be the final
one. Now take a step back, look at what happened to your source code through the weeks, and reflect on
your practical progress with this course.
Reflect on what you have learned from Software Engineering Methods lab, what you have learned about
yourself as a team of programmers, and how you will use this in the future to design and implement
software systems. To help yourself in this task, you can also consider the first version of your game that
you submitted for evaluation after two weeks and compare it with the version you submit as a final product
for evaluation. Submit an essay of approximately 1,000 words with your reflection'
