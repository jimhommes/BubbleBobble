\chapter{20-Time, Revolutions}

\section{Question 1}

The final thing we wanted to add to our game, was a boss. The boss has to have the ability to shoot the player. To make this boos harder to kill we gave the boss a few lives. Now when you have completed all the normal levels, the boss level appears, and when you kill the boss you win the game.

\section{Question 2}

\subsection{Introduction}

For the FinalEnemy we had to create two new classes, 'FinalEnemy' and 'BubbleEnemy', both these classes are related to other classes.

\subsection{Responsibility Driven Design} 

\subsubsection{FinalEnemy}
\textit{Responsibility:} \\
The final enemy has to be able to move from the top to the bottom of the screen, and it has to be able to shoot a BubbleEnemy. When the player hits the final enemy with it's bubble, he has to lose a life. \\ \\
\textit{Collaborations:} \\
FinalEnemy collaborates with Observable to be able to send updates to Observer classes. It also collaborates with  the SpriteBase, to get the x and y, and with both the Bubble extendsions, to fire bubbles and to be shot by bubbles.

\subsubsection{BubbleEnemy}
\textit{Responsibility:} \\
The BubbleEmey's are shot by the FinalEnemy, these bubbles have the ability to move through walls. When one of these bubbles hits the player, the player has to die. \\ \\
\textit{Collaborations:} \\
BubbleEnemy collaborates with Observable to be able to send updates to Observer classes. It also collaborates with  the SpriteBase, to get the x and y, with the FinalEnemy to be shot by, and with the Player to kill.

\subsubsection{Highscore}
\textit{Responsibility:} \\
The StartController asks the name(s) of the player(s) via the NameInputController. The highscores are build up of HighscoreEntryControllers, which gets and sets the scores in Settings. \\ \\
\textit{Collaborations:} \\
StartController collaborates with NameInput and HighscoreEntryController to manage custom player names for the highscores. HighscoreEntryController collaborates with Settings to save and retrieve the highscores so they are saved even after the game is stopped.
