\chapter{Non-Functional Requirements}

The non-functional requirements are the requirements that are based on the operation of the system, instead of the functions and behaviour of the game itself.

\begin{itemize}

	\item A working version of the game must be delivered September 11th, 2015.
	\item SCRUM will be used for every iteration, after the original working version is delivered.
	\item The player should be able to understand the controls almost immediately, so have the ability to play the game properly within three attempts of the game.
	\item The game should be able to run on Windows (7 or higher), Mac OS X (10.8 and higher) and Linux.
	\item The game will be implemented in Java. 
	\item The working version delivered will have at least 75\% line coverage in Cobertura, where the tests are meaningful. Meaningful means that they do not only execute functions, but actually test the game.
\end{itemize}
