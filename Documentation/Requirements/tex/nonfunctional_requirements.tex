	\item A working version of the game must be delivered September 13th, 2015.

	\item A user should be able to understand the controls in less than a few minutes.
	\item The game should be able to run on Windows (7 or higher), Mac OS X (10.8 and higher) and Linux.
	\item The game shall be implemented in Java.
