\chapter{Simple logging}

\section{Question 1}

``Extend your implementation of the game to support logging. The game has to log all the actions
happened during the game (e.g., player moved Tetris piece from position X to position Y ). The
logging has to be implemented from scratch without using any existing logging library. Define your
requirements and get them approved by your teaching assistant.''
