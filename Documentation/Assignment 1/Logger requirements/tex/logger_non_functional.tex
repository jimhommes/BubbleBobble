	\item A working version of the logger must be delivered September 18th, 2015.
	\item The logger must be compatible with the Bubble Bobble game that has been developed. 
	\item The logger should be able to run on Windows (7 or higher), Mac OS X (10.8 and higher) and Linux.
	\item The logger will be implemented in Java. 
	\item The logger delivered will have at least 75\% line coverage in Cobertura, where the tests are meaningful. Meaningful means that they do not only execute functions, but actually test the game.
