\section{Question 3}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Test Driven Development}: This would probably be a good practice. Although Test Driven Development might take more time and could therefore maybe end up in the `Cost over Time'-quarter, it would probably end up as a Good Practice. This is because the developed software will be more maintainable and will be easier to verify for bugs. Because of this, the quality of the software will improve which will mean relatively fewer costs than, for example, when bugs have to be removed at the end. Test Driven Development also means investing a little more time in testing while developing software. This could result in a relatively longer duration, but we are convinced that this little investment of time will result in lower overall duration of the project, since bugs will be found easier and therefore will help prevent more bugs. 
	\item \textbf{Including Design Patterns}: This would probably be good practice mainly due to the same reasons as Test Driven Development. Initially working with Design Patterns might take a bit more time and will require a team with more skills (so more expensive employees). However in the end it will results in easily extendable and more maintainable software which will result in a positive practice. 
	\item \textbf{Visual Development Process}: With this we mean that during the development process, intensive use is made of visualisation (such as UML's) to keep track of for example software structure or model relations. We believe that this will result in a global understanding of the desired structure of the application which will result in lower cost and duration. It is easier to discuss problems, improve software or add new features, once it is understood how the application will be / is constructed. Visualisation is a very good way of doing all of this.
