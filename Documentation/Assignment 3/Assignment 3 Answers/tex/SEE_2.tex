\section{Question 2}

``Explain why Visual Basic being in the good practice group is a not so interesting finding of the study
(3 pts).'' \\

As described on page 70 of the paper, only 6 projects with the Project Factor ``PPL Visual Basic'' were analysed. Of those 6 projects, 5 scored as a Good Practice and one scored as Cost over Time. Therefore the Project Factor ``PPL Visual Basic'' was selected as one of the factors which relate to Good Practice. As you can see however, the number of samples in this group is too small to conclude that Visual Basics always is a success factor. A good improvement would be to set a minimum sample size $n$ in order to be selected as a success or failure factor.
