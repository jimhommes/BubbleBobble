\chapter{Resonsibility Driven Design}
Here the features of Respsonsibility Driven Design will be explained per feature we added this sprint.

\section{Jumping on Bubbles}
\subsubsection{Player}
\textit{Responsibility:}  \\
The player class will handle the movement of the player. \\
\textit{Collaborations:} \\
It will be communicating with SpriteBase for collisions. \\

\subsubsection{SpriteBase}
\textit{Responsibility:}  \\
SpriteBase will be responsible for detecting collisions with BubbleSprites. \\
\textit{Collaborations:} \\
It will be communicating with Player. \\

\section{Warping}
\subsubsection{Level}
\textit{Responsibility:}  \\
When loading the map, it should be clear where the player is able to warp. \\
\textit{Collaborations:} \\
When the player collides with a warpable area, Level should communicate with Player to tell him where he warped to. \\

\subsubsection{Player}
\textit{Responsibility:}  \\
This class will be moving the player and spawning it after the warp. \\
\textit{Collaborations:} \\
When the player warped, it communicates with ScreenController to be redrawn. \\

\section{Refactoring Controllers for Testing}
\subsubsection{LevelController}
\textit{Responsibility:}  \\
The responsibility for this class will \textit{only} include creating levels and all communication between the objects in the game. \\
\textit{Collaborations:} \\
It will communicate with the objects in de game (Model package) and with the MainController. It will also be the bridge to ScreenController for the SpriteBases. \\

\subsubsection{MainController}
\textit{Responsibility:}  \\
MainController will be the controller that is loaded by the FXML. It will have all untestable objects and will seperate the GUI from the LevelController. \\
\textit{Collaborations:} \\
LevelController and ScreenController will communicate via MainController. \\

\section{Better Physics}
\subsubsection{Player}
\textit{Responsibility:}  \\
Player is responsible for the movement of the player itself. \\
\textit{Collaborations:} \\
Player will be communicating with LevelController for the set of walls it could collide with. This all affects the physics. \\
